# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the complete project files and documentation for my Data Science/Data Analytics internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**, where I analyzed **social media sentiment** using **NLP, Python, Power BI, and Excel**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to perform sentiment analysis on over **600 social media posts** across platforms like **Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit**, focusing on trending tech hashtags such as:

- #AI  
- #MachineLearning  
- #DataScience  
- #CloudComputing  
- #Python

Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and the **VADER sentiment analyzer**, we classified sentiments into **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** categories and visualized key trends using **Power BI**.
